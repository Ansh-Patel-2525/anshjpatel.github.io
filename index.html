      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a final year Master’s student in Mathematics at the University of Warwick with strong interests in
        mathematical modelling, data analysis, and technology. I enjoy applying rigorous mathematical ideas
        to real world problems and building practical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my academic work, I have gained experience through internships and technical roles,
        where I developed strong problem solving, analytical, and communication skills.
